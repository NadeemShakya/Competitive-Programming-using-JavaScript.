## From a given array, reverse the array without using a new array i.e. Your code must be an In-place algorithm.

### Solution: 

<b>What is an Inplace Algorithm? </b>
<br/>
An in-place algorithm is an algorithm that does not need an extra space and produces an output in the same memory that contains the data by transforming the input ‘in-place’. 
However, a small constant extra space used for variables is allowed.
